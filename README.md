#Find 5 Challenge
- Using excanvas for the canvas elements used to draw boxes around the answers for old versions of IE
- canvas.text.js also for handling text on canvas in IE?
- fader.js is for the sounds, I think?
- soundmanager2-nodebu-jsmin.js is for handling html5 compliant audio and falling back to flash audio if needed
- need to update jquery version, test first
- RSS list is broken because of change to naming convention, change it to split on "Challenge: " rather than char number

###ToDo
- [ ] Mobile coordinates still messed up
